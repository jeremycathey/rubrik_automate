# rubrik_automate
Collection of scripts for Rubrik Automation
This is intended to make it easier to demonstrate the Rubrik API first ecosystem and allow prospects and existing customers to more easily see/use Rubrik's APIs for common tasks.

This will be an ongoing project with the next phase to include proper error catching/handling and automatic code upgrades to the latest version.  Please stay tuned.  Feel free to let me know if there are any feature requests or modifications that you would like to see.
